# Analysis Summary

## Research Question
How does digital advertising spend affect online sales performance for SMEs on eBay?

## Key Insights

### 1. Spend Dominates Performance
- Ad spend alone explains 93.3% of revenue variation
- Other metrics (CTR, clicks) show no significant independent effect
- Platform algorithm handles optimization automatically

### 2. Strong Returns with Diminishing Effects
- 9:1 return on ad spend (€9 revenue per €1 spent)
- Elasticity of 0.94 indicates slight diminishing returns
- Optimal spending range: €20-50 per campaign

### 3. Model Robustness
- Consistent results across multiple specifications
- Test performance exceeds training (no overfitting)
- Cross-validation confirms stability

## Practical Recommendations

### For SMEs:
1. Focus on budget allocation over optimization
2. Start with €20-30 test budgets
3. Scale when ROAS > 7:1
4. Don't obsess over CTR metrics

### For Consultants:
1. Emphasize strategic over tactical decisions
2. Use simple ROAS tracking
3. Account for ~20% campaign failure rate

## Limitations
- Cross-sectional data (no temporal dynamics)
- Single platform (eBay specific)
- Survivor bias (excluded failed campaigns)
